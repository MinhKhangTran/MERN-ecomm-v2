# MERN E-Commerce
An e-commerce app built with the MERN stack. The backend has three models: User, Products and Orders.  
Every User can see the available products and add them to the cart. Sadly, You cannot buy these stuffs. There is even roles and permissions.  
  
  
  
The backend used technologies like node, express, mongoose and some validation, async-handler and access control.  
  
The frontend was made with react, redux toolkit, typescript and chakra UI.  
  
This project is based on brad traversy mern course on udemy with my own flavor
